        <p>
          If you want to succeed in this industry, all it takes is a good head
          on your shoulders (this IS thought-work after all), a love for solving
          puzzles/problems, and a determination that won't quit.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is my job to teach you the good parts of JavaScript, the most
          useful aspects of functional programming, and of course, how to write
          beautiful, clean ReactJS code!
        </p>
