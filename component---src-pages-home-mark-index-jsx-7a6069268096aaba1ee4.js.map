My name is Mark Tellez and I have been a JavaScript developer\n          since 1997. I have spent my entire adult life writing software for the\n          web and I did it without going to University or even graduating High\n          School!\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If you want to succeed in this industry, all it takes is a good head\n          on your shoulders (this IS thought-work after all), a love for solving\n          puzzles/problems, and a determination that won't quit.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          It is my job to teach you the good parts of JavaScript, the most\n          useful aspects of functional programming, and of course, how to write\n          beautiful, clean ReactJS code!\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  )\n}\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
